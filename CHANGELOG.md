# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **P1-13**: CLI search command now uses `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLDS.LOW` constant instead of hardcoded 0.3
- **P1-14**: Fixed regex inconsistency in `detectCategory` - phone number regex now has length limit (10-13 digits) and word boundary
- **P1-15**: Email regex now consistent between `shouldCapture` and `detectCategory` (strict anchored pattern)

### Added
- **P2-16**: Embeddings initialization with retry mechanism (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- **P2-20**: Input sanitization function to remove HTML tags, control characters, and normalize whitespace
- **P2-21**: Qdrant connection health check on plugin startup (non-blocking, logs warnings if connection fails)

### Security
- Enhanced ReDoS protection with word boundaries in phone number regex
- Input sanitization prevents XSS and injection attacks in stored memories
- All regex patterns now have proper length limits and boundaries

### Testing
- Added comprehensive self-validation test suite (29 tests, 100% pass rate)
- Tests cover: input sanitization, category detection, capture filtering, ReDoS protection, edge cases, Chinese language support

## [1.0.9] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Configurable memory limit**: New `maxMemorySize` config option (default: 1000, range: 100-1000000)
  - Users can now customize the maximum number of memories in in-memory mode
  - LRU eviction automatically removes oldest memories when limit is reached
  - Set to 999999 for unlimited storage (no automatic deletion)
  - Only applies to in-memory mode, external Qdrant has no limit
  - Documented in README.md and openclaw.plugin.json with clear help text

### Changed
- Improved startup log to show configured memory limit or "unlimited" status
- Added warning in README about potential memory exhaustion with unlimited mode

## [1.0.8] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **P0 - Memory leak**: Added MAX_MEMORY_STORE_SIZE (1000) limit with LRU eviction for in-memory mode
- **P0 - Version inconsistency**: Synced openclaw.plugin.json version with package.json
- **P1 - ReDoS vulnerability**: Improved regex patterns to prevent catastrophic backtracking
  - Phone number regex: limited to 10-13 digits
  - Email regex: more strict pattern with anchors
- **P1 - Error information leakage**: Changed console.error to api.logger.error
- **P1 - Log level**: Changed frequent info logs to debug level (autoRecall, autoCapture)

### Changed
- Extracted magic numbers to SIMILARITY_THRESHOLDS constant for better maintainability
- Improved code consistency across all search operations

### Security
- Reduced ReDoS attack surface with stricter regex patterns
- Better error handling to prevent information disclosure
